## Version Control Flow

Each member should contribute to a branch separate from the main branch, for example I (yousef) will add,commit and push my changes to a branch that has my name "yousef", this is not completely formal in the programming world but in our use case it will be fine to do that.

Each member should contribute to a branch separate from the main branch. For example, if i am contributing to the
customer module, i will create a new branch called "customer-module" and i will push all my changes to that branch.

Then, when your changes are ready to be merged to the main branch, please create a pull request on GitHub indicating you want to merge your branch with the main branch.

To view branches:
```
git branch
```

to create a new branch:
```
git branch new-branch-name
```

to switch to a branch
```
git switch branch-name
```

to add and commit your files
```
git add .
git commit -m 'description of changes'
```

to push your files
```
git push
```

To update your directory with the LATEST changes
```
git pull
```
